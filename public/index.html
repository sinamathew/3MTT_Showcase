    <section class="introduction">
      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>I'm excited to share my learning journey in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) with 3MTT (Three Million Technical Talents) program.  This page documents my experiences and discoveries as I delve into this fascinating field with the help of 3MTT's resources and training.</p>

      <h2>My Learning Process</h2>
      <p>My journey began with enrolment into the AI/ML program (Cohort 2), which grant me access to the community resources while waiting to be paired with a training provider.  As I progressed with the help of 3MTT resources, I explored but not limited to AI fundamentals, Introduction to programming, AI models and Dataset, Supervised/Unsupervised/Reinforcement Learning as well as Entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p>Here are some additional resources that I found helpful: <a href="https://academy.postman.com/path/postman-api-fundamentals-student-expert">Postman API Fundamentals,</a> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/git/">GIT,</a> <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow,</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">Web Development,</a> </p>
